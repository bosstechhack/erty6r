<p>Your time is limited. By the time you finish this sentence, someone will visit and abandon your 
    website. Unless you give your visitors a reason to stick around, they're gone. High bounce rate is an 
    indicator of visitors' lack of interest</p>

<h3>Here are some of the most common problems in website design:</h3> 
<ol>
    <li><b>There's no clear path.</b> You want to extend a warm welcome to your visitors. Give them an 
        easy way in and through. Too much competition for attention is a turn off. When you 
        provide too many options, the functional result is no options.
        </li>
    <li><b>Outdated design.</b>  Your site was state of the art in 2009. It's got a header, a couple of 
        sidebars, and a big chunk of information running down the center. Guess what? It looks like 
        it's nearly a decade old. Because it is. Time to refresh with current design thinking. The 
        layout of a page has evolved over the past decade. These days the best sites break up content 
        into smaller, digestible bits.</li>  
    <li><b>Overused stock images and icons.</b> If visitors see the same image on multiple sites, it erodes 
        trust. That picture of people sitting around the conference table? They sure get around to a 
        lot of offices!</li> 
    <li><b>Too many textures and colors.</b> You are trying to add interest, but you just add clutter. Limit 
        colors and fonts. Maintain a thematic color scheme. For professional sites, try to limit the 
        variety of fonts to three or fewer.</li>         
</ol>
